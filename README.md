# HyunCalculator

**v1.2.0-alpha.2** · **한국어 / English** · Desktop (Windows, macOS, Linux) · Python 3.11+

An integrated scientific, graphing, financial, quantitative finance, programmer and ML/DL/RL calculator, based on the original bilingual 19-function Tkinter calculator.

## v1.2.0-alpha.2 — Expanded Formula to Code (in progress)

The Code Generator now catalogs all **33 Financial/Quant functions** and exports
**all 33 as standalone Python source**, matching the original calculator's numeric
outputs (including arrays, simulations and performance records). For the other
**13 languages**, 11 formulas currently have code emitters: 7 established finance
formulas plus GARCH(1,1) one-step metrics, GBM/OU analytic moments, and trade
cost metrics. **176 of the targeted 462 formula × language combinations can
produce source**, compared with 98 in alpha.1.

**Important: source generation != validation.** Python source for all 33 functions
is compiled and checked against the v1.1 calculator's 33 example inputs.
Other-language emitters underwent limited real compiler/runtime smoke tests;
**no claim is made that all 176 combinations are independently compiled and
numerically verified**. Go, Rust, R, MATLAB, Julia and unavailable toolchains
must be verified in appropriate runtime environments before relying on output.

- **Python 33/33:** 7 existing standalone algorithm emitters and 26 exported
  from reviewed, trusted source definitions in the repository. Depending on
  formula, Python code may require `numpy`/`scipy` (printed in the generated
  dependency header); `imports=standard` rejects formulas requiring these.
- **11/33 across 14 languages:** FIN-001, FIN-002, FIN-003, FIN-004, FIN-007,
  FIN-008, FIN-009, TS-002, STOCH-001, STOCH-002, STRAT-001.
- **Remaining 22:** Python only for now; selecting another language explicitly
  reports the adapter as not implemented. They are **not** emitted as placeholders.
- **Output semantics:** Python returns the reference numeric values, dictionaries,
  and arrays. Portable quant emitters return named records where supported
  (e.g. JS object, R list, MATLAB struct, Julia named tuple), or ordered
  numeric arrays with explicit output-index labels elsewhere.
- **Options:** Auto or Advanced class/function where supported; naming and
  variable mapping; `for` or `while` for NPV; automatic or standard imports.
  Full numerical library/provider selection and iteration variants for the
  remaining quant functions are not implemented yet.

The bilingual Code Generator tab offers formula/language selection, source
preview, copy and save. Non-supported language/formula combinations are disabled.
The generated code is **not executed automatically by the UI**.
The [v1.2 technical design](docs/FORMULA_TO_CODE_V1_2_DESIGN.md) describes the
remaining 286 source-generation combinations, systematic toolchain testing,
advanced model algorithms, output packaging and accessibility goals.
Existing Scientific/Graphing/Financial/Quant/Programmer/ML/DL/RL calculators
are preserved.

## Install & run / 설치 및 실행

```powershell
# Windows PowerShell, from the project root
py -3.12 -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m hyuncalculator
```

```bash
# Linux/macOS
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m hyuncalculator --lang en
```

**GUI note:** requires a local desktop session with Tkinter/Tk support. Linux might require `python3-tk` from the OS package manager; SSH/headless servers cannot show GUI windows.

### Test / 테스트

```bash
python -m hyuncalculator --test
# or
python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
# run historical regression suite
python hyuncalculator/legacy_ml.py --test
```

GitHub Actions runs unit tests on Python 3.11 and 3.12. The **95 automated tests** include existing regression, financial/quant, and code generation verification; all computational tests run without GUI/display. See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for the 10-domain implementation checklist.

### Examples / 예제

Scientific: `sin(pi/6) + sqrt(16)`, `factorial(6)`, `log(100)` (base 10), `ln(e)`.

Graphing: `y=sin(x); y=x^2/10` with X minimum `-10`, maximum `10`.

Financial: `NPV` takes cash flows starting at t=0: `-100, 60, 60`, discount rate `0.1`.

Quant: Black–Scholes `S=100, K=100, T=1, r=0.05, sigma=0.2, q=0, call` should return approximately `10.45058357`. Black–Litterman row input `0.04,0.01;0.01,0.09` is a 2×2 covariance matrix.

Programmer: base=16, value=`FF`, width=8 yields signed `-1`, unsigned `255`.

### Newly added examples (v1.1.0) / 추가 예제

- **Normal probabilities / 정규분포:** `x=1.96, mean=0, std=1, p=0.95` gives PDF, CDF, survival probability, Z-score, and the `p` quantile.
- **Bond YTM / 채권 만기수익률:** `price=1000, face=1000, coupon=0.05, years=5, freq=2` gives nominal annual YTM `0.05` (5%). Input price is the **dirty/full** price and assumes equal coupon periods with no accrued-interest adjustment.
- **Moving averages / 이동평균:** series `1,2,3,4,5` with window `3` gives SMA `[2,3,4]`; EMA is seeded by the first observation.
- **Brownian, GBM, OU:** generate seeded example paths as well as simulated and theoretical terminal mean/volatility. `paths * steps` is capped at 2 million. GBM/OU transitions are exact under the stated model parameters.
- **Transaction costs / 거래비용:** notional `100000`, commission `5` bps, slippage `3` bps, half-spread `2` bps, 2 sides yields estimated total cost `200`.
- **Backtest / 백테스트:** input period returns and close-of-period target weights in `[-1,1]`. The weight **is delayed by one full period** to avoid lookahead (`position[t]=signal[t-1]`). The initial position is zero and the final unexecuted signal is ignored. Commission and slippage are in basis points per unit of **absolute turnover**. The backtest reports net/gross returns, buy-and-hold, Sharpe/Sortino, CAGR, drawdown, wins, turnover, and the equity curve.

### Inputs, conventions and limitations / 입력 규칙

- **Rates and returns are decimals**, not percentages: `0.05` means 5%; maturities are in years where specified. Enter per-period rates for time-value/loan calculations.
- Separate vector values with commas or spaces. Separate matrix rows with **semicolons** (`;`).
- `^` is power in Scientific/Graphing modes, not XOR. Use `XOR` in Programmer mode.
- Graph functions use `x`. No arbitrary Python execution is permitted: the expression parser validates every AST node and function name, and does **not** use `eval`.
- Covariance matrices must be positive definite for inverse-based optimization. Portfolio weights are fully invested and **short-selling is permitted**; there are no transaction costs or constraints.
- Black–Scholes applies to **European** vanilla options; Greeks use changes of 1.00 in annual decimal vol/rate (divide Vega/Rho by 100 for per 1% point). At zero T or vol, undefined Greeks are NaN.
- Historical VaR is the quantile of **signed losses**; VaR can be negative in profitable scenarios. Historical ES is the mean of losses above/equal to the empirical quantile; small samples are noisy.
- IRR searches a finite range and rejects detected **multiple roots**; changing-sign roots can be missed in degenerate/tangent cases.
- Monte Carlo uses a fixed seed and antithetic paths, with pair-based standard errors; **use an even number of paths**.
- Backtest uses one instrument with fractional long/short weights limited to [-1,1] and applies close-to-close simple returns. It assumes immediate frictional execution, no borrowing/financing charges or market impact, and **no terminal liquidation charge**. Use research-grade, time-aligned return/position data; it is not a broker or production backtest engine.
- Brownian, GBM and OU path simulations are stochastic and reproducible given the same seed. Theoretical outputs assume constant parameters.
- UI field values remain intact when toggling Korean/English. No data is transmitted to a server.

This application is for education, research prototyping and numerical checks—not financial, investment or risk management advice. Validate model assumptions and numerical results independently for consequential decisions.
